\usage{
rmsle_vec(truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)

rmsle(data, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{truth}{The column identifier for the true results
(that is \code{numeric}). This should be an unquoted column name although
this argument is passed by expression and supports
\link[rlang:topic-inject]{quasiquotation} (you can unquote column
names). For \verb{_vec()} functions, a \code{numeric} vector.}

\item{estimate}{The column identifier for the predicted
results (that is also \code{numeric}). As with \code{truth} this can be
specified different ways but the primary method is to use an
unquoted variable name. For \verb{_vec()} functions, a \code{numeric} vector.}

\item{na_rm}{A \code{logical} value indicating whether \code{NA}
values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}

\item{data}{The dataframe which stores the predictions and the actuals.}
}
\description{
Calculate the root mean squared log error. In the case of RMSE, the presence
of outliers can explode the error term to a very high value. But, in the
case of RMLSE the outliers are drastically scaled down therefore nullifying
their effect. RMSLE incurs a larger penalty for the underestimation of the
Actual variable than the Overestimation. This is especially useful for
business cases where the underestimation of the target variable is not
acceptable but overestimation can be tolerated.
